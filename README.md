# My Personal Project

## Food Diary 
This project will consist of a program that will help the user reach their weight goal  
by tracking the calories of  foods the user eats in a day. A daily calorie allowance will  
be calculated  based on information provided by the user and the program will help  
the user to keep watch of their calorie intake in a day, making sure it does not exceed the daily allowance.
