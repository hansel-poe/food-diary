# My Personal Project

## Food Diary 
This project will consist of a program that will help the user reach their weight goal  
by tracking the calories of  foods the user eats in a day. A daily calorie allowance will  
be calculated  based on information provided by the user and the program will help  
the user to keep watch of their calorie intake in a day, making sure it does not exceed  
the daily allowance. This program is intended for someone who wishes to lose weight and monitor     
their eating. The idea for this program comes naturally to me as I, myself, am currently trying to  
lose weight and be more mindful of what I eat. I figured this program will be helpful to someone who  
is on a weight loss journey like I am.
